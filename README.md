### Hi there, I'm Brian!

- 🏫 I'm a student at Stanford CS, and my research interests lie in AI (Computer Vision/Reinforcement Learning), Autonomous Systems, Robotics, and all things Space.
- 🤖 When I'm not in school, my main projects are all about deploying autonomous robots in a wide variety of off-road settings - on Earth, in Air, and in Space.
- 😎 Talk to me about alpine skiing, commercial aviation, my writings, basketball/squash, and traveling!
- 📫 You can reach me at brianwu@cs.stanford.edu, or you can [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/BrianWu568/).
